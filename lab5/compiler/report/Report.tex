\section{Unsafe Mode}

The following list describes all safety checks that are performed in \texttt{safe} mode and not performed in
\texttt{unsafe} mode.

\begin{itemize}
\item Array bounds checking during write and read.
\item Null checking before struct field access. For example, before evaluating \texttt{s->f}, a null check
is performed on \texttt{s}.
\item Check that shift value falls in the range $[0, 31]$ for left and right shifts.
\item Check requested array size non-negative before \texttt{alloc\_array}.
\end{itemize}

The difference between safe and unsafe mode is most noticeable in tests that make frequent memory accesses.
For example, the execution time of \texttt{mmult2.l4} dropped by almost $60\%$ when compiled with the
\texttt{--unsafe} flag. We attribute this to the number of conditional jumps that can be removed from the
code when bounds checking is ignored. Using naive safety checks, an array access inside a loop results in
bounds check every time the loop goes around. There may be ways to compile safely and decrease execution
time by hoisting some of these checks outside of the loop. \texttt{shifts.l4} ran $85\%$ percent faster.
We attribute this to the removal of conditional branching from every arithmetic shift.

\section{Instruction Selection}
Before optimizations, all conditional branches were encoded in a piece of abstract assembly that looks like
\texttt{ifz v l}, which says to check the value of \texttt{v} and jump to \texttt{l} if it is zero. This makes
the translation for a statement like the following rather bulky.

\begin{verbatim}
if (x > y) {
  return 1;
} else {
  return 0;
}
\end{verbatim}

First, the expression \texttt{x>y} is computed down to a value $b$ of zero or one, using a comparison and a set
instruction. Then, $b$ is compared to zero. There is room for optimization here, because our use of set 
instructions and the second comparison is really just a rewrite of the built-in x86 conditional jumps. Our
optimization introduces a new abstract assembly construct \texttt{comp v1 v2 op l}, which says to compare
\texttt{v1} to \texttt{v2} using the binary comparison operator \texttt{op} and jump to \texttt{l} if the result
of the comparison is false. This allows the above example to be translated to a single \texttt{cmpq/cmpl} 
instruction.

The effect of this optimization is most noticeable in programs that make use of loops that go around a
large number of times. The exit conditions are checked much more efficiently using this improved translation.

 
\section{Constant Propagation and Folding}


\section{Eliminating Register Moves}

We noticed two patterns in our assembly that could be optimized, so two peephole optimizations were implemented
directly on the x86 assembly. The first was to remove jumps that jump to the next line in the file. A jump
looking like the following is removed.

\begin{verbatim}
    jump l
l:
\end{verbatim}

We also noticed patterns of moves that look like the following.

\begin{verbatim}
movq a x
movq b x
\end{verbatim}

These two lines can be optimized to \texttt{movq b x} as long as the first move is guaranteed to have no effect
on the value of $b$ (this is not always the case).

\section{Common Subexpression Elimination}
We implemented a rather conservative version of common subexpression elimination. The only common computations
we eliminate are multiplications which don't involve memory references. This optimization has the most noticeable
effect on the \texttt{qsort.l4} test. The swap function involves writing to a memory block immediately after
reading from the same block. The multiplication to compute the array access offset is only done once with this
optimization. We certainly could do more to reduce redundant memory loads, but this does something.

Applying this optimization introduces more opportunities for copy propagation.
